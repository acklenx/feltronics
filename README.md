## Project Mission and Overview

Feltronics is an open-source electronics project that transforms everyday surfaces into an engaging, tactile learning space.

By replacing traditional, fiddly breadboards with **large, magnetic felt pieces**, we make learning fundamental electrical engineering principles accessible, durable, and fun. Users can quickly snap together functional electronic circuits onto any metal surface‚Äîlike a refrigerator or filing cabinet‚Äîusing components concealed within the soft, fabric pieces.

This concept originated at Hackerspace Charlotte and won the Grand Prize at the Global Hackerspace Challenge in 2011. This repository serves as the definitive documentation and assembly guide for recreating the Feltronics set.

## üí° Key Features of Feltronics

Feltronics is designed to be an ideal learning tool for all ages, promoting:

* **Educational Outreach:** Perfect for demonstrating basic circuits in schools, workshops, or science museums.

* **Rapid Prototyping:** Allows for quick, solder-free testing of simple analog circuits.

* **Durability and Fun:** A robust and tactile electronics kit that encourages hands-on experimentation.

## üíª Code Simplicity and Project Accessibility

This project's documentation is built for extreme simplicity and long-term accessibility, ensuring the instructions are always available, regardless of web trends.

The website is delivered entirely via a **single, highly optimized HTML file** (`index.html`).

* **Self-Contained:** All necessary CSS styling and utility JavaScript are **embedded directly** within the `index.html` file.

* **Zero Dependencies:** The project requires no Node, NPM, React, or any other complex framework to run.

* **Easy Hosting:** To view the guide, you just need to **double-click the `index.html` file** in your local browser, or deploy the file and its companion asset folders (`images/`, `downloads/`) to any static file hosting service (Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc.).

This clean design ensures the guide is preserved and universally accessible.
